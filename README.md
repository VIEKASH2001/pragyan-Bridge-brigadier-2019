# pragyan-Bridge-brigadier-2019

This project documents the development of a differential drive robot with a gripper mechanism designed to participate in the Pragyan competition, organized by the Techfest of NITT. The aim of the competition was to construct a robot capable of carrying blocks and filling gaps between bridges, while successfully navigating through them and completing the track on time.

The project showcases the team's efforts to design, build, and program the robot to meet the competition's requirements. The repository contains the source code and documentation for the project, including the robot's mechanical design, electronics, and control algorithms.

Through this repository, we aim to provide a detailed insight into the development process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented, along with the team's performance and outcomes in the competition.
